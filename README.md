# 📈 Forecasting Website Active Users with Time Series Modeling

This repository contains an educational project focused on time series modeling to forecast the number of active users on a website over time. Using simulated or sample data, the project demonstrates step-by-step how to analyze, visualize, and model time series data with Python.

## 🔧 Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebooks)
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Statsmodels** – time series modeling (ARIMA, decomposition, trend and seasonality analysis)

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice exploratory analysis of time series data  
- Apply basic modeling techniques like decomposition and ARIMA  
- Evaluate and interpret forecasts of active users  

This project is ideal for beginners learning time series analysis through a practical, hands-on example.
